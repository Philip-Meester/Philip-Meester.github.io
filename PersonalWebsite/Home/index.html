        </h2>
        <p id="biography">Starting as a tech support rep, I've navigated an unconventional path into tech. Despite lacking formal education, I seized opportunities like a Process Improvement Analyst role, where I honed skills in business analytics and Salesforce administration.
        In four years, I've become a <strong>Certified Salesforce Admin</strong> and a <strong>Certified Mulesoft Developer</strong>, contributing to a leading medical software company. Now, I'm eyeing the role of <strong>Mulesoft Architect</strong> and exploring <strong>Full-Stack Development</strong>.
        Join me on this journey of growth and innovation. Check out my ongoing projects and let's connect!
